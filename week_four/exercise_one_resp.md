# 🛡️ Threat modelling intimate partner violence: team exercise  

## 📝 Overview  
You will work in **4 teams**, each assigned a **specific section of the article**.  
Each team will **read, summarise, and present** their findings, leading to a final discussion.  

---

## 🎯 Team breakdown (4 groups)  

### **1️⃣ Tech abuse and IoT risks**  
📖 **Pages:** *663–665* (Introduction + IoT-enabled technology-facilitated abuse)  

🔍 **Focus:**  
- Define **technology-facilitated abuse (tech abuse)** in the context of **intimate partner violence (IPV)**.  
- Explain how **IoT devices** (smart locks, GPS trackers, smart speakers) are misused for control and surveillance.  
- Discuss **real-world impact on victims**, citing examples from the reading.  

---

### **2️⃣ Threat modelling and cybersecurity gaps**  
📖 **Pages:** *666–669* (Cybersecurity design shortcomings + A method to threat model IPV tech abuse)  

🔍 **Focus:**  
- Explain **threat modelling** and how it shifts focus from **system risks to human risks**.  
- Highlight **how traditional cybersecurity models fail in IPV contexts**.  
- Discuss **why abusers are “authenticated” adversaries** and how **existing security frameworks ignore insider threats**.  

---

### **3️⃣ Smart lock case study: attack vectors and threats**  
📖 **Pages:** *670–676* (Threat modelling a smart lock: what can go wrong?)  

🔍 **Focus:**  
- Analyse **how smart locks and other IoT devices are exploited in IPV**.  
- Explain the **five attack vectors** (e.g., ownership-based access, account compromise, monitoring).  
- Connect these **risks to wider issues in authentication, access control, and security loopholes**.  

---

### **4️⃣ Mitigation strategies and ethical challenges**  
📖 **Pages:** *677–681* (What should you do? + Limitations and validation)  

🔍 **Focus:**  
- Evaluate **proposed solutions** (e.g., multi-factor authentication, consent-based access control).  
- Discuss **ethical dilemmas in designing security measures** that could also be misused by abusers.  
- Reflect on **the responsibility of IoT vendors, policymakers, and security professionals** in preventing tech abuse.

## ⏳ Exercise flow (1 hour)  

### **⏲️ 1. Team work (25 min)**  
📌 Each team **reads their assigned pages**, extracts key points, and prepares a **5-minute presentation**.  
💡 They should consider:  
- **What are the key risks in this section?**  
- **How does it relate to authentication, access, ethics, and trust?**  
- **What are the cybersecurity design flaws?**  

---

### **📢 2. Team presentations (20 min)**  
- Each team **presents their section** to the rest of the class.  
- Other teams **take notes and prepare questions**.  

---

### **💬 3. Final discussion (15 min)**  
🔗 Bringing everything together:  
- **How do these sections connect?**  
- **What surprised you about IPV threats in cybersecurity?**  
- **What is missing in IoT security policies?**  
- **Who should take responsibility—companies, policymakers, or users?**
