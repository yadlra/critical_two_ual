# Reflection Questions: Tech Abuse as a Cybersecurity Challenge 🔐

1. 🤔 How does this article reframe our understanding of cybersecurity by shifting focus from external attackers to "authenticated adversaries" within intimate relationships? What implications does this have for how we design secure systems?

2. 💻 The authors introduce the concept of "UI-bound adversaries" in tech abuse scenarios. How is this different from traditional cybersecurity threat models, and why might this perspective be dismissed or overlooked by mainstream security professionals?

3. 🔍 Evaluate the five attack vectors described in the smart lock case study. Which do you think poses the greatest risk to intimate partner violence victims/survivors and why?

4. ⚖️ The article discusses how power dynamics in relationships (including gender, technical ability, and finances) can influence who controls smart home devices. How might these dynamics affect the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies?

5. 🔄 The authors note that certain design features can be "dual-use" - beneficial for legitimate users but exploitable by abusers. Choose one IoT feature discussed in the paper and analyse this tension. How might designers navigate this challenge?

6. 🧩 What are the limitations of applying traditional cybersecurity frameworks to intimate partner violence contexts? How does the authors' proposed IPV threat model address these limitations?

7. 🤝 The chapter emphasises that technical solutions alone cannot solve tech abuse. What role should policymakers, support services, and technology companies each play in addressing this issue?

8. 🏋️‍♀️ How might the concept of "safety work" described by Harris and Woodlock (2019) help us understand the additional burdens placed on victims/survivors in navigating technology?

9. 🌐 The authors suggest that improving IoT security for IPV victims/survivors could also benefit general users. Do you agree with this assessment? What security improvements proposed might have the widest benefits?

10. 📱 This article was published in 2021. In what ways might technological developments since then have changed the landscape of tech-facilitated abuse, and how might the proposed threat modelling approach need to adapt?
